## Teacher-Awarded GPA Analysis Project
This project is tailored specifically for Queens College students and is spearheaded by a team of dedicated researchers. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of GPA averages awarded by teachers across diverse subjects from the academic years 2017 to Fall 2022 (excluding 2020). We aim to offer a data-driven alternative to resources like Rate My Professors, assisting students in making informed instructor selections.

### Scope
We are examining:

- Average GPA trends per semester
- Relative difficulty of classes within subjects
- Variations in GPA vs. RMP scores

### Progress
Our initial analysis for the Computer Science (CSCI) department is complete, and we are now expanding our focus to other subjects including Mathematics (MATH) and Accounting (ACCT). We are diligently working towards covering all major subjects offered at Queens College.

### Technologies Used
- Python for programming and data manipulation
- Jupyter notebooks for code sharing and collaboration
- Pandas and NumPy libraries for efficient data frame operations

### Future Plans
- We are looking forward to incorporating data visualization libraries for better interpretation and representation of our findings.

### Contributions
- We invite interested Queens College students and faculty to contribute and help us improve this project. Please feel free to submit issues, fork the repository and send pull requests!
