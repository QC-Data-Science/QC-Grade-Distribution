## Teacher-Awarded GPA Analysis Project
This project is tailored specifically for Queens College students and is spearheaded by a team of dedicated researchers. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of GPA averages awarded by teachers across diverse subjects from the academic years 2017 to Spring 2023 (excluding 2020). We aim to offer a data-driven alternative to resources like Rate My Professors, assisting students in making informed instructor selections. 

### Scope
We are examining:

- Average GPA trends per semester
- Relative difficulty of classes within subjects
- Variations in GPA vs. RMP scores
- Withdrawal Percentages
- Standard Deviation of grades within classes

### Progress
Analysis of CSCI and Math department is taking place, working towards analyzing each semester and looking at it all together. Analysis of the Accounting subject is also taking place 

### Technologies Used
- Python for programming and data manipulation
- Jupyter notebooks for code sharing and collaboration
- Pandas and NumPy libraries for efficient data frame operations
- Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly for Data Visualizations

### Future Plans
- We are diligently working towards covering all major subjects offered at Queens College

### Contributions
- We invite interested Queens College students and faculty to contribute and help us improve this project. Please feel free to submit issues, fork the repository and send pull requests!
